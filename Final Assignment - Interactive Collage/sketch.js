//Creative Coding Final Assignment: Interactive Photo Collage

/*Inspiration and sources
British & Exotic Minerology by Nicholas Rougeux: https://www.c82.net/mineralogy/
I was intrigued by the arrangement of the different minerals that seemed rather neat as a whole but upon zooming in, I noticed that the illustrations were of 
irregular shape and did not specifically follow a grid format. The color palette was also harmonious, in addition to the intuitive mouse interactions. This 
collage is of quite a large scale, consisting of 718 illustrations by James Sowerby, an early 19th-century British naturalist and mineralogist.

I chanced upon an article about a vet who had pinned up witty explanations of cat bahaviours on his cork board. As the illustrations in the article are all in grayscale, 
I will be sourcing for similar/new illustrations with the addition of gifs/videos to better illustrate the cat behaviours
